# CoinBase
CoinBase Unofficial UWP app made with GDAX C# API on VisualStudio 2017.

Currently it shows graphics for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, the three most used cryptocurrencies on the market.

It lets you choose the time-span of the graphics (last hour/day/week/month...), and also lets you choose between a light and dark theme for the app.
